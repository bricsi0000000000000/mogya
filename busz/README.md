# Buszos

We have several people who want to get to work using the same bus line, for which the **travel** **times** are **given**.

We know **where** these people work (at which **station**), and **when** they should **start** **working** there.

We have **several** **busses** that we can schedule to bring these people to work.

It can be assumed (for now) that the **capacity** of the busses is **unlimited**.

**Everyone must to get to work on time**, and we want to ***minimize the total wasted time before work***, that happens when someone arrives early.
